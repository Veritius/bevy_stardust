## Features
- Tightly integrated with Bevy ECS - everything is part of the `World` and `App`, using the scheduler for parallel network code, even in your game systems.
- Architecture agnostic - use client/server, peer to peer, mesh networks, you name it.
- Send data any way you want, over UDP, WebRTC, WebSockets - you don't even need to use the Internet: use AM radio or even [maritime signal flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags) if you really want to.
- No matter the transport layer you use, write the same code in your game systems, entirely in parallel using Bevy's scheduler.
- Add network-enabled Bevy plugins with no extra effort on your end.

### Planned features

    - Fragmentation
