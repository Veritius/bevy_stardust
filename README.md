# bevy_stardust
A (very opinionated) experimental client/server networking crate for Bevy, fully operating within the ECS paradigm.

This crate is highly experimental and you shouldn't use it for anything you care about. Things *will* break.
This is also a hobby project. It's probably not very good, but you're more than welcome to help out!

If you want a thin wrapper around renet, use [bevy_renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet/tree/master/bevy_renet) or if you want something with more granular control use [naia](https://github.com/naia-lib/naia).

Minimum supported Rust version is the latest stable release.
