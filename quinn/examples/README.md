# Examples
Since QUIC requires encryption and authentication by default, before running the examples, the certificates must be generated. Go to the `certs` directory, and just run the `generate.sh` script. Make sure the working directory is in `certs` or it won't work properly. You can double check that the certificates are generated correctly with `verify.sh`.
